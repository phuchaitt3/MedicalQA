        "question": "A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman reports experiencing sharp pain in the right groin for the past two weeks, which is alleviated by standing. Her blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 88 bpm. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs or gallops, and abdominal, lung, and genitourinary examinations are unremarkable, with no palpable hernias. On osteopathic evaluation, there is tenderness at L4 and L5 in the right paraspinal region. The right sacral sulcus is shallow, and the right inferior lateral angle is posterior. A seated flexion test is positive on the right. Radiographic imaging of the hip and lumbar spine shows no acute or chronic abnormalities. Which of the following structures is most likely implicated in the patient’s condition?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Sacrotuberous ligament (B) Quadratus lumborum muscle (C) Piriformis muscle (D) Posterior sacroiliac ligament (E) Iliolumbar ligament (F) Anterior sacroiliac ligament (G) Psoas major muscle (H) Sacrospinous ligament (I) Gluteus medius muscle (J) Iliacus muscle",
